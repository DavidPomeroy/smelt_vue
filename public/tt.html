		<li style="margin-bottom:18.0pt;" value="1"><span>The Landlord agrees to let to the Tenant, and the Tenant agrees to take a tenancy of the house, known as and forming This Rental House (the "Property"), for use as residential premises only. </span><br>
		</li>
		<li class="lh" style="text-align:left;"><strong><u><span>Term</span></u></strong><strong><u><br></u></strong>
		</li>
		<li style="margin-bottom:18.0pt;" value="2"><span>The term of the tenancy commences on 1 March 2023 and ends on 29 February 2024 (the "Term").</span><br>
		</li>
		<li style="margin-bottom:18.0pt;" value="3"><span>Should neither party have brought the Tenancy to an end at or before the expiry of the Term, then a new tenancy from month to month will be created between the Landlord and the Tenant which will be subject to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement but will be terminable upon the Landlord giving the Tenant the notice required under the applicable legislation of England (the "Act").</span><br>

		</li>
		<li style="margin-bottom:18.0pt;" value="8"><span>At all reasonable times during the Term and any renewal of this Agreement, the Landlord and its agents may enter the Property to make inspections or repairs, or to show the Property to prospective tenants<br><br> or purchasers in compliance with the Act.</span><br>
		</li>
		<li class="lh" style="text-align:left;"><strong><u><span>Renewal of Agreement</span></u></strong><strong><u><br></u></strong>
		</li>
		<li style="margin-bottom:18.0pt;" value="9"><span>Upon giving written notice no later than 60 days before the expiration of the Term, the Tenant may renew this Agreement for an additional term. All terms of the renewed agreement will be the same except for this renewal clause and the amount of the rent. The Landlord may increase the rent from the initial term. &nbsp;If the Parties cannot agree as to the amount of the rent, this Agreement will not be renewed and the Tenant must vacate the Property at the end of the initial Term.</span><br>
		</li>
		<li class="lh" style="text-align:left;"><strong><u><span>Tenant Improvements</span></u></strong><strong><u><br></u></strong>
		</li>
		<li style="margin-bottom:18.0pt;" value="10"><span>The Tenant will obtain written permission from the Landlord before doing any of the following:</span><br>

		</li>
		<li style="margin-bottom:18.0pt;" value="13"><span>The Tenant will inform the Landlord if the Tenant is to be absent from the Property for any reason for a period of more than twenty-eight (28) days. The Tenant agrees to take such measures to secure the Property prior to such absence as the Landlord may reasonably require and take appropriate measures to prevent frost or flood damage.</span><br>
		</li>
		<li style="margin-bottom:18.0pt;" value="14"><span>If the Tenant no longer occupies the Property as its only principal home (whether or not the Tenant intends to return) the Landlord may, at its option, end the tenancy by serving a Notice to Quit that complies with the Act.</span><br>
		</li>
		<li style="margin-bottom:18.0pt;" value="15"><span>If the Tenant has abandoned the Property and the Landlord is unsure whether the Tenant intends to return, the Landlord is entitled to apply for a court order for possession.</span><br>
		</li>
		<li style="margin-bottom:18.0pt;" value="16"><span>If the Tenant has abandoned or surrendered the Property and the Landlord feels that the Property is in an insecure or urgent condition, or that electrical or gas appliances could cause damage or danger to the Property then the Landlord may enter the Property to carry out urgent repairs. If the locks have been changed for such urgent security reasons, the Landlord must attempt to provide notice to the Tenant of the change in locks and how they can get a new key.</span><br>
		</li>
		<li style="margin-bottom:18.0pt;" value="17"><span>If there is implied or actual surrender of the Property by the Tenant, the Landlord may, at its option, enter the Property by any means without being liable for any prosecution for such entering, and without becoming liable to the Tenant for damages or for any payment of any kind whatever, and may, at the Landlord's discretion, as agent for the Tenant, let the Property, or any part of the Property, for the whole or any part of the then unexpired term, and may receive and collect all rent payable by virtue of such letting, and, at the Landlord's option, hold the Tenant liable for any difference between the Rent that would have been payable under this Agreement during the balance of the unexpired term, if this Agreement had continued in force, and the net rent for such period realised by the Landlord by means of the letting. Implied surrender will be deemed if the Tenant has left the keys behind or where the Tenant has ceased to occupy the Property and clearly does not intend to return.</span><br>
		</li>
		<li style="margin-bottom:18.0pt;" value="18"><span>If the Tenant has abandoned or surrendered the Property and the Tenant has left some belongings on the Property, the Landlord will store the Tenant's possessions with reasonable care for a reasonable period of time taking into consideration the value of the items and cost to store them. Once the cost of storage is greater than the value of the items, such items may be disposed of by the Landlord.</span><br>
